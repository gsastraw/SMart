# SMart: A simple way to manage your projects!

Welcome to the SMart project management tool! The goal of SMart is to allow you to be able to manage your projects in a clear, simple, and efficient way. The program features tools such as time tracking, built in issue management, customizable user profiles, and administrative tools for simple management of your user base.

# Install 

Installing SMart is very simple. Clone or pull the project from the repository, and run the program from your preferred IDE under **se/gu/smart/Main**.   If you would like to run the program outside of an IDE, you can use Maven to run the program from the terminal:

```
./mvnw clean javafx:run
```

# Creating Your Personalized Account

If you would like to create your own account, you will have to log in as an admin. The admin details are:
    
    Username: admin
    Password: pass

Once in the admin panel, go to "Create User" and type in a username, full name, and password of your choice. If you would like to create your own admin account, simply click on "Admin User" and make sure it is checked. 

Your account is now created, and you can now log in. Log out of the admin panel when everything is to your liking.
